# Visualizing Banglore City Ward data

This repository showcases sample work from a collaborative project with the goal of making government data available for every Indian citizen.

## Overview

In these Jupyter notebooks, I've implemented various libraries to handle, manipulate, visualize, and analyze datasets. The key libraries used include:

1. **pandas:** For handling and manipulating datasets.
2. **matplotlib:** For plotting values in graphs or maps.
3. **geopandas:** For creating interactive maps to better understand the presented data.
4. **scikit-learn:** For predicting missing data from the dataset.

## Notebooks

Feel free to explore the sample Jupyter notebooks, where I've applied these libraries to make government data more accessible. The source of the data used in each notebook is mentioned within the notebook itself.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
